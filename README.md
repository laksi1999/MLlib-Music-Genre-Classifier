# Music Genre Classification with MLlib

## Overview
This project implements a music genre classification system using Apache Spark's MLlib. It classifies song lyrics into genres like Pop, Country, Blues, Jazz, Reggae, Rock, Hip-Hop, and an additional genre added through a custom dataset. A web-based user interface allows users to input lyrics and visualize results.

## Project Structure
```
- /src                  # Source code for the model and interface
- /datasets             # Contains Student_dataset.csv and Merged_dataset.csv
- run.bat               # Batch file to launch the web interface
- 190346A.mp4           # Video demonstration of the system
- README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Usage
1. Run the `run.bat` file to start the web interface.
2. Open the local URL in your web browser.
3. Input song lyrics and click the classification button to view results.

## Video Demonstration
A video demonstration is included (190346A.mp4), showcasing:
- System initiation
- Classification of songs from both datasets
- Testing with a song from an untrained genre
