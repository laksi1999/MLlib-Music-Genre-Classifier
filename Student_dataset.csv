Adele,I Drink Wine,2021,soul,How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes? How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like? We're in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine They say to play hard you work hard find balance in the sacrifice And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied [Pre-Chorus] You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin' tryin') To keep climbin' (Climbin' climbin') But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser [Chorus] So I hope I learn to get over myself Stop tryin' to be somebody else So we can love each other for free Everybody wants somethin' you just want me [Verse 2] Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control? Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know? In these crazy times I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to 'Cause I need some substance in my life somethin' real somethin' that feels true You might also like[Pre-Chorus] You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried I've cried) High tides (High tides high tides) 'Cause I want you so bad but you can't fight fire with fire oh [Chorus] So I hope I learn to get over myself Stop tryin' to be somebody else Oh I just want to love you love you for free Everybody wants somethin' from me you just want me [Bridge] Listen I know how low I can go I give as good as I get You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left Oh I hope in time (Hope in time) We both will find peace of mind (We both find) Sometimes the road less travelled is a road best left behind [Chorus] Well I hope I learn to get over myself Stop tryin' to be somebody else Oh I just want to love you love you for free yeah 'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me you just want me [Refrain] You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin' tryin') To keep climbin' (Climbin' climbin') But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser [Outro] The only regret I have I wish that it was just at a different time A most turbulent period of my life Why would I put that on you? That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about But because of that period of time Even though it was so much fun I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him There was just memories in a big storm16Embed
